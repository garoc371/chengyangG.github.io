:::{.home-bio}
I am a PhD student in Statistics at University College London, where I develop methods for causal inference in the context of health technology assessment and value of information analysis.

On this site, you'll find a list of my research projects and contact information. A blog - for notes, TILs and occasional technical writing - is coming soon.
